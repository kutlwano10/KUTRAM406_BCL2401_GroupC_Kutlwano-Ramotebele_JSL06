# CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

## Objective:
 The project's objective is to create a user-friendly interface for customers, allowing them to effortlessly browse the menu, select desired items, and view their total order. Through this project, we gain insights into implementing various functions and their interconnection within a web application.

## Chalenges:

I encountered a challenge where clicking on a menu item resulted in displaying all items in the list instead of just the clicked item. This unexpected behavior was a bug that needed fixing.I had a litle problem of implementation, How to use some js syntax like forEach and what to include.

# Solutions:
I updated the code to make sure that only the item clicked by the user gets added to the order list. Before, all items were being added to the list when any item was clicked. By fixing this, now only the item that's clicked gets added, making the ordering process easier and more straightforward for users.

# Improvements:
I aim to do alot more practical examples on this type of challenges . I want to understand how to envoke functions and use them wisely without the help of reseaching how to do it.
